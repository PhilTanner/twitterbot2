In your words
Planning on helping to automate the process of facilitating the #nzsecretsanta now that NZ Post has stopped doing it - it's been run by some volunteers manually this year #SecretSantaNZ2019 - I want to help them make it easier next year. There's a couple of tweets outlining my broad idea here: https://twitter.com/Phil_Tanner/status/1185051922056638464
Analyze Twitter data
Yes
People wanting to play the game in 2020 would send out a tweet saying a specific phrase, such as "I'm taking part in #SecretSantaNZ_2020". The bot will watch for this phrase, reply to the tweet saying "Do you want to be added to the list? Reply to this tweet with "yes" to confirm adding to be confirmed. Bot will watch for replies to these tweets to compile the player list. There will also be additional watches, so tweets @ing the account with keywords of "Help" and any optional details will reply with more details on that aspect (like rules, shipping dates, how block lists are handled etc),
Tweet, Retweet or Like?
Yes

There will also be additional watches, so tweets @ing the account with keywords of "Help" and any optional details will reply with more details on that aspect (like rules, shipping dates, how block lists are handled etc), DMs will be employed (with keywords) to do non-public updates, such as telling Santa the address to send your present to (with a DM @SecretSanta_NZ "#ADDRESS: 123 Example Street, Townsville, NZ") or sending DMs to the players letting them know who they are selecting presents for and sending them their Santees address to send the present they have procured for them to.
Show Tweets or Twitter information off Twitter
Yes
Display Tweets outside of Twitter
Show aggregate data about Twitter content
Collcetions of the twitter handles of the players taking part in the game will be collated into an external location (not publicly available). The addresses of these players will also be recorded for their gift to be sent to. Who they are playing as santa for will also be recorded, along with the tracking code of the present they've sent to their Santee. All collated somewhere (possibly Google Sheets? Haven't researched their API yet, but might be option) outside of Twitter. Will also think about doing some form of tie in for reading players block lists...
Providing Tweets or Twitter information to government entities
Yes
There is no intention to do so as part of the development. However, if there are any laws that require us to release information due to anti-terror (or other) legislation, I would of course be compelled to comply & supply that info to the government of New Zealand.
